## About

The AI Image Generator is a project that leverages machine learning models to generate images. It can be used for a wide range of applications, from generating art to creating placeholder images for websites and applications.

## Demo

Provide a link to a live demo of your AI Image Generator if available. You can also include examples of images generated by the system.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the AI Image Generator on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your machine.
- Dependencies specified in the project's requirements.txt file.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-image-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ai-image-generator
   ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Explain how users can interact with the AI Image Generator. If it's a web-based tool, describe how to access it in a web browser. If it's a command-line tool, provide instructions on how to run it.

For example:

- To generate an image, run the following command:

  ```bash
  python generate_image.py --parameters parameter_file.json --output output_image.png
  ```

- Provide a sample JSON parameter file that users can use as a template.

- Include any additional usage instructions, such as how to customize image generation parameters or how to input text or data for image generation.

## Features

List the key features of your AI Image Generator. For example:

- Generate images based on predefined parameters.
- Support for customizing image styles and attributes.
- Export generated images in various formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
